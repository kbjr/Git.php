h2. Description

A PHP git repository control library. Allows the running of any git command from a PHP class. Runs git commands using @proc_open@, not @exec@ or the type, therefore it can run in PHP safe mode.

h2. Requirements

A system with "git":http://git-scm.com/ installed


h2. CodeIgniter Version

This library was originally coded with "CodeIgniter":http://codeigniter.com in mind. Due to this, there is a second version of this library (the file @CI_Git.php@ in the repository) which is coded _slightly_ differently for easier implementation in a CI website.
